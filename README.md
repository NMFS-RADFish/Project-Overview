# RADFish Project Overview

This project will eventually comprise of multiple repositories. The `Project-Overview` repository will serve as a guide to the associated repositories along with descriptions for what role they play within the overall project.

## Project Motivation

> NMFS proposes to build a mobile-first progressive web application (PWA) framework for fisheries electronic reporting (ER) as a joint cross-regional effort. RADFish: provides standardized components, packages/libraries, dev tools, and documentation; this framework accelerates project initiation, reduces development overhead, and ensures adherence to NMFS branding, section 508 compliance, and U.S. Web Design System standards; accessible via GitHub it fosters collaboration, prevents redundant efforts across teams, and promotes consistent best practices, ultimately enhancing efficiency and reducing time and costs in ER system development.

## Project Goal

> A mobile development framework, governance policy, and standards for new and/or improving electronic reporting applications, e.g., logbooks, observers, dealers, for NMFS and our partners.

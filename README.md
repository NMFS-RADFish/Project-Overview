# Project-Overview

## RADFish Project Motivation

> NMFS proposes to build a mobile-first progressive web application (PWA) framework for fisheries electronic reporting (ER) as a joint cross-regional effort. RADFish: provides standardized components, packages/libraries, dev tools, and documentation; this framework accelerates project initiation, reduces development overhead, and ensures adherence to NMFS branding, section 508 compliance, and U.S. Web Design System standards; accessible via GitHub it fosters collaboration, prevents redundant efforts across teams, and promotes consistent best practices, ultimately enhancing efficiency and reducing time and costs in ER system development.
